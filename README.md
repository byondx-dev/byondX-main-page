# ByondX Futuristic Landing Page

Immersive marketing site for an AI-first technology studio. The layout leans into cinematic gradients, glassmorphism cards, and subtle motion to highlight SmartHome, AI, and Cloud offerings inspired by the original [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/o1kQEqkrOR6rvuFFrg10qY/Futuristic-Landing-Page-Design).

## ✨ Highlights
- Animated hero section with floating particles powered by `motion`
- Modular Radix UI components for navigation, dialogs, and interactive content
- Responsive Tailwind design tuned for desktop and mobile breakpoints
- Ready-to-brand sections: About, Services, Case Study, and Contact CTA
